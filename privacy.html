    <p>Last updated: January 16, 2026</p>

    <p>At Dawn ("we," "us," or "our"), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous metrics regarding how often the app is opened or which features are used to improve user experience.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
