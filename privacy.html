    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 29, 2026</p>

    <p>At Dawn ("we," "us," or "our"), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> The text, thoughts, and feelings you input into the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Mood Data:</strong> Your selection of "Happy" or "Sad" status.</li>
        <li><strong>Support Inquiries:</strong> If you contact us via email, we collect your email address and message content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> We collect anonymous device identifiers (e.g., Device ID, model, OS version) to manage your preferences and subscription status without requiring a login.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We collect anonymous data on how you use the App (e.g., screens visited, features used) to help us improve the experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Approximate Location:</strong> We may use IP-based general location (City/Country) to display your anonymous post on the Global Feed map. We do <strong>not</strong> collect precise GPS coordinates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We process your data based on legitimate business interests and the necessity to fulfill our contract with you (providing the Service):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To generate personalized prayers and reflections via AI.</li>
        <li>To manage your account, preferences, and subscription.</li>
        <li>To monitor usage trends and improve App functionality.</li>
        <li>To detect and prevent fraudulent or abusive activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Private Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> Your data is stored on secure, private servers hosted by <strong>Digital Ocean</strong>. We maintain full control over this infrastructure and do not rely on public, shared backend-as-a-service platforms for core data storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit (using SSL/TLS) and sensitive data is encrypted at rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Data Processors</h2>
    <p>We share minimal data with trusted third-party providers solely to operate the App. We do not sell your personal data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic):</strong> We send your text input to these providers <em>solely</em> to generate the prayer response. <strong>Privacy Note:</strong> We have opted out of data training. Your journal entries are not used to train their public AI models.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used to process and validate App Store subscriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used to serve advertisements in the free version of the App. They may use device identifiers to show relevant ads (subject to your consent settings).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We retain your data only as long as necessary to provide the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Hard Delete:</strong> You can request a complete data wipe at any time by using the "Hard Delete" or "Delete Account" button in the App Settings. This action is irreversible and immediately removes your data from our live production servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Data Rights (GDPR & CCPA)</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> You can ask us to delete your personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt-out of personalized advertising via your device settings or the in-app consent manager.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover we have collected information from a child under 13, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
