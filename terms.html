    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 29, 2026</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Dawn mobile application (the "App"). <strong>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</strong> If you disagree with any part of these terms, you may not access the App.</p>

    <h2 id="eula">1. End User License Agreement (EULA) & Content Policy</h2>
    <p>Dawn fosters a supportive environment. By using the App, you agree to our <strong>Zero Tolerance Policy</strong> for objectionable content.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prohibited Content:</strong> You may not post content that is defamatory, harassing, threatening, bigoted, hateful, violent, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, or otherwise offensive or that harms or can reasonably be expected to harm any person or entity.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> We reserve the right, but do not assume the obligation, to monitor user content. We may remove any content or ban any user at our sole discretion, without prior notice, if we believe a violation has occurred.</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting Mechanism:</strong> Users can flag objectionable content or block abusive users directly within the App. We commit to reviewing all reported content within 24 hours and taking appropriate action, including removing content and ejecting the user who provided the offending content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. User Accounts & Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for your use of the App and for any content you provide, including compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> You are responsible for safeguarding your account details. Since Dawn uses anonymous identifiers, losing your device data may result in loss of account access.</li>
        <li><strong>Age Requirement:</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to use the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
    <p>Dawn offers optional "Premium" subscription plans (e.g., Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) via Apple App Store and Google Play Store.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Payment will be charged to your Apple ID or Google Play account at the confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li><strong>Renewal Charges:</strong> Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the cost of the chosen package.</li>
        <li><strong>Management:</strong> You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your device's <strong>Account Settings</strong> after purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> As a digital service, all sales are final. Refunds are handled exclusively by the respective App Store (Apple or Google) according to their policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Content Ownership & Rights</h2>
    <p><strong>Your Content:</strong> You retain ownership of the text you input into the App. You are free to share your content elsewhere.</p>
    <p><strong>Our License:</strong> By posting content to the Global Feed, you grant Dawn a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, display, and perform such content in connection with the App's service (e.g., displaying your anonymous prayer to other users).</p>

    <h2>5. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The App uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate prayers, blessings, and reflections based on your input.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Guarantee of Accuracy:</strong> AI may "hallucinate" or generate text that is factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unrelated to your input. Dawn makes no warranties regarding the accuracy, quality, or appropriateness of generated content.</li>
        <li><strong>Not Religious Advice:</strong> Generated content is for mindfulness purposes only. It does not carry religious authority and is not a substitute for spiritual counsel from a qualified leader.</li>
        <li><strong>User Discretion:</strong> You are solely responsible for evaluating the generated content before relying on it or sharing it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <div class="important">
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Dawn is a mood journaling and spiritual tool. It is <strong>NOT</strong> a medical device and is <strong>NOT</strong> a substitute for professional mental health care. If you are experiencing a crisis, severe depression, or suicidal thoughts, please contact emergency services immediately.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>7. Service Availability & Updates</h2>
    <p>We work hard to keep Dawn running, but we cannot guarantee that the App will be available at all times. The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We may update, change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the App at any time without notice.</p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon termination, your right to use the App will immediately cease.</li>
        <li><strong>Survival:</strong> All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Dawn and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the App, or b) a breach of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall Dawn, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the App; (iii) any content obtained from the App; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content.</p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
